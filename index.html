    <p>Where did you learn what it means to reciprocate? <br>
      And how much can I be expected to tolerate? Uh <br>
      So I started to think 'bout the plans I made
      The debt unpaid <br>
      And you just can't call a spade a spade</p>

    <p>I watch the moon <br>
      Let it run my mood <br>
      Can't stop thinking of you <br>
      I watch you (now I let it go) <br>
      (And I watch as things play out like) <br>
      So long nice to know you I'll be moving on</p>

    <p>We started off in such a nice place <br>
      We were talking the same language <br>
      I open and I'm closing <br>
      You can't stand the thought <br>
      Of a real beating heart <br>
      You'd be holding, having trouble
      Owning and admit that I am hoping</p>

    <p>I watch the moon <br>
      Let it run my mood <br>
      Can't stop thinking of you <br>
      I watch you (now I let it go) <br>
      (And I watch as things play out like) <br>
      So long nice to know you I'll be moving on
      Moving on</p>

    <p>You, yeah I always know the truth <br>
      But I can't just say it to you <br>
      Yeah, I know the truth <br>
      I knew <br>
      Yeah, I always know the truth <br>
      But I can't just say it to you <br>
      Yeah, I know the truth</p>

    <p>I never thought we'd see it through <br>
      I never could rely on you <br>
      And few times your face came into view <br>
      Into view <br>
      I'm not into you <br>
      Into you</p>
